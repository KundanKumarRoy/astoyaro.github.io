                    <h3 class=" py-3 heading position-relative ">-: Refund And Cancellation Policy:- </h3>
                    <p>We have created the best platform to provide astrological services to customers from different
                        parts of the world. Our aim is to satisfy you with highly accurate astrological readings. Still,
                        a few customers claim a refund for some reason. We do not compel them to pay for the service
                        that they have not availed of. Our company has implemented some refund and cancellation policies
                        for our customers.</p>
                    <ul class="l-itme text-dark">
                        <li>
                            Every time customers place an order, it undergoes processing. So, when the order for an
                            astrological report has reached this processing stage, we will accept no refund request. The
                            user will bear the liability and risk of placing an order carelessly careless. We will not
                            be responsible for a refund while we have already processed the order.
                        </li>
                        <li> There is no refund for the order, which has already been executed. However, the user can
                            think of canceling an order before execution by communicating with our customer care
                            representatives. It should be done within an hour of paying our company. We will then decide
                            on the potential to refund the amount.</li>
                        <li> In some cases, our website has technical glitches and errors at the time of processing the
                            request. You might have placed the order for generating the astrological report. However,
                            you should acknowledge that the timelines displayed for the report are a rough estimate.
                        </li>
                        <li> We request everyone to recheck the information provided to our team. We will not make a
                            refund request for incorrect information. Thus, before hitting the Submit button, you must
                            check the accuracy of your details. However, while you have already submitted the data, you
                            can connect with us in an hour to request a modification. Our team will surely do it for
                            you.</li>
                        <li> Our company does not process any refund for returning the damaged product. As a website
                            user, you should acknowledge that while ordering the displayed product on your site, you
                            will be liable for post-delivery damages caused to that product. In the case of the COD
                            payment mode, you will be charged for the product based on what is shown on the platform.
                            Courier and shipping charges will be applicable.</li>
                        <li>We can consider a pro-rata refund for the delay in activating subscription services. We will
                            also make a refund for damages caused to your product during the transit.</li>
                        <li>You need to acknowledge that the product image displayed on the website is only for
                            reference purpose. We try our best to deliver the product in the condition that is shown on
                            the site. You can exercise your own discretion in this situation. We will not make any
                            refund until you have shown strong reasons.</li>
                        <li> The products sold by us or services provided by our company are not intended for the
                            replacement of medical, emotional, and philosophical treatments. The company is not liable
                            for the reliability of astrological services and the gems sold by us. You will be at the
                            sole discretion for availing of our services and buying our products.</li>
                        <li>We will not accept any refund request for providing incorrect contact details. It is
                            especially true when you like to have the astrological service through email and phone
                            calls. That is why you should double-check your contact to avoid wasting your money. We will
                            not process the refund for the call that gets connected.</li>
                        <li>In some cases, server problems like slow server performance can cause problems to the
                            payment gateway page connected to our site. Before attempting the second payment, you have
                            to check your bank account. While the amount has been debited, it is better to avoid making
                            a repayment.</li>
                        <li>We will process it after deducting the transaction charges, courier charges, and shipping
                            charges when you are eligible for the refund. Custom duty is also applicable in some cases.
                        </li>
                        <li>In case, when the amount has been debited from your bank account, you must ensure that you
                            have not paid us twice. You may also connect with our customer representatives to confirm
                            your payment. On the contrary, you can make a fresh payment when you find the amount not
                            debited from your account. </li>
                        <li>In some instances, although you have taken precautionary steps, you make multiple payments
                            for a particular order. We will surely make a 100% refund the amount without deducting
                            transaction charges. We will retain the amount needed for the single order.</li>
                        <li>Some orders are not acceptable to us, and thus, we can cancel them anytime. The reason for
                            cancellation may be the pricing errors, inaccuracy of details, non-availability of our
                            service, and several other problems. Due to these unforeseen issues, we will cancel the
                            order and refund the amount you have paid for booking our services.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So, these are some refund and cancellation policies of our company. Before placing your order,
                        you must read these policies thoroughly. To solve further queries about the refund, you can
                        contact our team. We will get back to your queries as soon as possible.
