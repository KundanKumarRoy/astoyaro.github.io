                            Tarot card reading is a kind of cartomancy in which practitioners supposedly use tarot cards to
                            acquire insight into the past, present, or future. You will ask any question about your life, the

                   <p> Kundli matching can be used to determine the level of compatibility between two spouses. The
                    physical and mental compatibility of two people can be determined via Kundli matching. The planetary
                    alignment and positions in both individuals' horoscopes can reveal their behavioral habits.

                    The odds of childbirth, as well as the happiness and health of the children, are all factors that
                    Kundli Matching can reveal. Nadi, the eighth Guna, carries the most points and might thus indicate
                    the likelihood of having offspring or the challenges that surround it. Kundli matching can also be
                    used to assess the health of the prospective bride and groom. It also reveals the level of physical
                    attraction between the prospective couple, ensuring that the future bride and groom retain the
                    appropriate level of desirability.</p>

                    <p>Discover the baby’s name that is astrologically accurate for your child. Can your baby’s name decide
                        their future? As per Astrology, baby names are selected based on the date of birth of the child.
                        Vedic astrology brings into account the zodiac sign and/or sun sign of your baby while choosing a
                        term that will bestow good fate and fortune upon the newborn as well as upon his/her family.
                        Both in the lives of the babies and their families, names and their sounds can elicit some
                        astonishing vibes and energy. They should be uplifting and contribute to the development of the
                        individual to whom they are given. Because each letter and sound is unique, it energizes and
                        activates distinct planets and their positions. As a result, baby names that are preserved on the
                        basis of their birth dates are recognized to be the best choices.
                        The babies enter the cosmic universe with their own separate souls and fates as soon as they arrive.
                        The newborns' names symbolize their connection to the universe. The significance of naming the
                        infant is revealed through a genuine astrological ritual so that it resonates with the cosmic
                        world's vibes and transforms into a haven of joy and blooming energy.

                    <h3 class=" py-3 heading position-relative">-:    Vaastu Consultancy :- </h3>

                    <p>Vastu is the balancing of five elements: earth, water, space, air, and fire; when all five elements
                        are placed in an exact ratio, positive bio-electric energy is produced, which provides health,
                        riches, prosperity, happiness, and serenity to residents. Astrology, on the other hand, is the study
                        of celestial bodies' locations and aspects in the idea that they have influence over natural (i.e.,
                        earthly) and human events. An Astro-Vaastu analysis is based on three parameters: the individual's
                        horoscope, (ii) Vastu Principles, and (iii) the favorable time or Muhurata.</p>

                   <p> Vaastu and Astrology are connected in some way. Vaastu is concerned with the correct directions,
                    while Astrology considers planets, houses, and signs that have the correct directions. The
                    relationship between Vastu and Astrology shows that each direction has distinct effects on different
                    people. Thus, an individual's horoscope is essential in order to do an accurate Astro-Vastu
                    analysis.</p>

                  <p>  Personal Vastu should align with an individual's horoscope in order for them to be successful in
                    life and enjoy prosperity and pleasure. Vastu principles can certainly enhance situations; but, an
                    Astro-Vastu can fully transform an individual's life, bringing them the highest level of
                    fulfillment, happiness, and tranquility.</p>

                   
                    <h3 class=" py-3 heading position-relative">-: Gemstone reading :- </h3>

                    <p>Gemstones are one of the most well-known Astrological remedies. Only a few people are aware that
                        gemstones are not a Vedic kind of cure, but rather a method that originated in the Middle East and
                        was brought to India. Vedic astrology has included gemstones in its melting pot because the method
                        has been in use for so long.</p>

                   <p> You can get your horoscope scanned for good gemstones based on the natal positions of the planets.
                    This one-of-a-kind analysis contains not only the gemstones' benefits but also the areas in which
                    they will improve. An aspect that is never mentioned in the negative list of jewels, includes those
                    that should not be worn due to potential bad effects.</p>

                    <p>
                        The spiritual inclination is one of the few uplifted states of mind that is motivated by something
                        other than monetary gain. It's something we're born with, or it's a reaction to material satiation
                        or the desire to cut back on material pursuits. Spirituality and religion are frequently confused,
                        yet they are extremely different. While religion tries to impose moral weight on people to prove
                        their spirituality, Spiritualism, on the other hand, relieves people of any burden or
                        responsibility, allowing them to live a more uplifting existence.
                    </p>

                   <p> Have you ever pondered what form you took in a previous life? There is a way to find out for
                    yourself if this is the case. Former life regression treatment is a type of hypnotherapy in which a
                    person can travel back in time and relive their past lives. It is a type of treatment in which the
                    practitioner looks for evidence of a previous life in your subconscious mind and helps you reconnect
                    with those memories. It can help us tackle challenges in our current lives by allowing us to access
                    those experiences and talk about them.</p>

                    <p>It is merely a technique for guiding our mind through the chaos of life and into a quiet, tranquil
                        and deep condition. Once you're at ease, the practitioner by your side will ask you what you're
                        feeling or seeing while allowing the emotions to flow freely. As you tell the professional what
                        you're hearing, seeing, or feeling, they take notes and share solutions that can improve your
                        current situation.</p>
                    <p>
                        At Astro Yaro, we frequently encounter people who believe that the agony and misery they are
                        experiencing in this incarnation is merely the result of their previous lives' actions, as do our
                        astrologers. However, other people wonder if they shouldn't have been created as humans in the first
                        place if they did awful things in their previous lives. The solution lies in the fact that certain
                        people are purposefully made human by the divine and are then swamped with troubles as a result of
                        the crimes they may have committed in a previous incarnation. Surprisingly, this treatment can also
                        be used to examine past life and current soulmate encounters. You can also learn life lessons
                        swiftly via previous life regression therapy, which would take a typical human a lifetime to master.
                        Birth Time selection</p>

                    <p>With the improvement of medical techniques, parents now have the option of planning their child's
                        birth and selecting a day and time for their child's birth several weeks in advance. Birth Time
                        Selection is an Astro Yaro’s special service that allows you to choose the most auspicious day and
                        time for your child's birth from among the possibilities provided by your doctor. It would be
                        advantageous for both the baby and the family if your kid was born on a lucky date and hour.</p>

                   <p> Our skilled Vedic astrologer will first compile both parents' birth charts using their dates, times,
                    and places of birth, and then investigate the houses that regulate pregnancy, childbirth, and family
                    growth. You will be given the optimum time of birth for your child after studying certain planetary
                    positions and combinations, which will be favorable for the child as well as the family in terms of
                    general luck, prosperity, fortune, domestic harmony, good health, and so on.

                   <p> Two things that have been lost cannot be recovered, according to Vedic wisdom. The first is 'life,'
                    and the second is 'health.' When it comes to health, the human body faces two challenges: genetics
                    and DNA that we are born with, and how we maintain and nurture our bodies.</p>

                    <p>While we can't control our genes, we can certainly control our lifestyle and food to ensure that our
                        bodies degrade as little as possible. Our lifestyle has a variety of effects on our health
                        throughout our lives. People with a very basic diet and lifestyle are more likely to suffer from
                        heart attacks, hypertension, and diabetes, yet other obsessive body abusers, who eat rich foods,
                        drink heavily, and smoke, appear to thrive and be in good condition. The explanation lies in a
                        combination of genetics and planetary alignments that determine whether or not a person is
                        susceptible to or immune to specific lifestyle diseases. You can order a Lifestyle Health Report to
                        assist you in unraveling your own body as well as the planetary mystery and chemistry.</p>

                  
                    <h3 class=" py-3 heading position-relative">-: Varshphal Annual Birthday horoscope :- </h3>

                    <p>Your birthday is an important annual occasion when the Sun returns to the same position it was at
                        the time of your birth, down to the degrees and minutes. Birthdays are a great opportunity to set
                        new resolutions and goals, as well as plan out the rest of the year. A Solar Return horoscope is a
                        notion in Vedic Astrology that is computed at the time and place when your Sun reaches the exact
                        degree and minute that it was at your birthday, year, and time.</p>

                   <p> The phrase Solar Return, or a 'Varshphal' in Sanskrit and Vedic nomenclature, refers to the annual
                    realignment that results in your birthday horoscope being formed for the exact moment at which this
                    conjunction occurs (these swings by up to 12 hours every year). The Varshphal is a scientific
                    horoscope that is valid for exactly one year, beginning with this year and ending with your next
                    birthday.</p>

                    
                    <h3 class=" py-3 heading position-relative">-:Fortune Reading - Dasha :- </h3>

                   <p> Dasha is a unique Vedic concept that assigns various planets definite time periods ranging from 6 to
                    20 years to display their effects over your lifetime. The consequences of a Dasha in operation
                    transcend all other impacts that are experienced due to various transits of planets, Sade-Sati, and
                    similar astrological events, according to Vedic Astrology.
                </p>
                    <p>The Dasha system has a 120-year full cycle that is divided into nine segments, each of which is held
                        by a different planet. We look forward to the parts of the cycle when the contributing planets are
                        strong. Whenever you've had a change in your life, whether for the better or for the worse, it's
                        always been due to a shift in your operating Dasha. It's all about predicting patterns in your
                        professional, financial, and personal lives, regardless of how long you've been doing it.</p>
<p>
    You could have a very powerful planet in your birth chart, but if that planet's Dasha does not work
    at the appropriate time in your life, it will be like "rain in the ocean," with no benefit.
    Similarly, you may have seen that some people succeed early in life, while others succeed later in
    life. All of this occurs as a result of a beneficent Dasha being operative at some point in their
    life, either early or late.

                    <h3 class=" py-3 heading position-relative">-: Nakshatras Detailed Reading :- </h3>

                   <p> Before the Zodiac signs (Aries through Pisces) came into use, the original Vedic tool of measure for
                    planetary placements was the Nakshatras or Constellations. Our research team has decided to
                    reintroduce our members to the highly skilled technique of Nakshatra-based readings. The entire
                    Zodiac spread is divided into 27 Nakshatras (28 if Abhijit Nakshatra is included), as opposed to the
                    Zodiac signs, which are divided into 12 portions and are therefore less precise than the Nakshatra
                    system.
                    </p>
                   <p>
                    In Vedic astrology, the usage of Nakshatra is far more essential than the use of zodiac signs. The
                    abodes into which the results of our effort (our Karma) are transferred and kept are known as
                    Nakshatras. The presence of planets and other deities in these Nakshatras aids in the analysis of an
                    individual's basic nature and how it influences various periods of their existence.

                    <h3 class=" py-3 heading position-relative"> -:  ShubhMuhurat’s :- </h3>

                  <p>  The astrological term for favorable and bad times is muhurat.' It is said that completing a task
                    during an auspicious muhurat increases the odds of success. That is, if you do the task at the
                    correct Muhurtha, it will provide you with the best possible result in accordance with your destiny.
                    As a result, muhurat should be considered before beginning any action.
</p>
                    <p>There are different auspicious muhurats for different works, just as there are different remedies
                        for different maladies. Muhurats were used in early Vedic times to perform yajnas, but due to their
                        numerous benefits and advantages, there has been an increased demand for muhurats in our daily
                        lives.</p>

                    <p>Muhurat is extremely beneficial to those who do not have a birth chart or who have a dosha. These
                        individuals appear to have completed their responsibilities successfully after following an
                        auspicious muhurat. Marriage is thought to be the start of a new life. Muhurat is very important in
                        marriage since it forecasts the most auspicious time and date for the marriage in order to ensure
                        optimal compatibility and happy life.</p>
